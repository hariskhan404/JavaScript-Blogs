Understanding JavaScript Variables
Introduction
JavaScript, one of the most widely-used programming languages, forms the backbone of modern web development. Understanding variables in JavaScript is essential since they are the building blocks for storing and managing data.

What are Variables?
A variable is a container that stores data or values that can be used and manipulated in a program. Think of variables as labeled boxes that hold information for you to use later.

In JavaScript, variables are declared using:

var (older method)
let (block-scoped, modern)
const (block-scoped, but immutable)
Syntax of Variables
Hereâ€™s how you declare variables:

// Using var
var name = "Alice";  // Declares a variable and assigns a string value

// Using let
let age = 25;  // Declares a block-scoped variable

// Using const
const country = "Canada";  // Declares a constant variable

Types of Variables
JavaScript variables can store different types of values:

Strings:
Represents textual data, enclosed in single or double quotes.

let greeting = "Hello, World!";
Numbers:
Represents numeric values, integers, or decimals.

let price = 19.99;
Booleans:
Logical values that are either true or false.

let isAvailable = true;
Null:
Represents an empty value.

let value = null;
Undefined:
Variables that are declared but not assigned.

let notAssigned;
Var, Let, and Const Comparison
Feature	var	let	const
Scope	Function-scoped	Block-scoped	Block-scoped
Re-declaration	Allowed	Not allowed	Not allowed
Re-assignment	Allowed	Allowed	Not allowed
Hoisting	Yes	Yes (not initialized)	Yes (not initialized)
Example of Variable Usage
let name = "John";      // String
let age = 30;           // Number
const isStudent = true; // Boolean

console.log(name);      // Output: John
console.log(age);       // Output: 30
console.log(isStudent); // Output: true
Conclusion
Understanding the differences between var, let, and const is crucial to write clean and efficient JavaScript code. Always use let and const over var for modern applications, as they are more predictable and reliable.
