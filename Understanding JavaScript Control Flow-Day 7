Day 7: Understanding JavaScript Control Flow ðŸŒ€
Welcome to Day 7 of our JavaScript blog series! Today, weâ€™re diving into control flow, a fundamental concept that lets you dictate how your code executes under different conditions.

With control flow, you can use decisions and loops to make your programs more dynamic and interactive. Letâ€™s get started!

What is Control Flow?
Control flow determines the order in which statements in your code are executed. JavaScript executes code sequentially by default, but with control structures like if, else, and loops, you can create conditional and repetitive logic.

Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions based on specific conditions.

1. if Statement
The if statement runs a block of code only if the condition is true.

Syntax:
if (condition) {
  // code to execute if the condition is true
}
Example:
let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
}

2. if...else Statement
The if...else statement runs one block of code if the condition is true and another block if itâ€™s false.

Syntax:
if (condition) {
  // code to execute if the condition is true
} else {
  // code to execute if the condition is false
}
Example:
let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}

3. if...else if...else Statement
The if...else if...else structure is used when you have multiple conditions to evaluate.

Syntax:

if (condition1) {
  // code to execute if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to execute if condition2 is true
} else {
  // code to execute if none of the conditions are true
}
Example:
let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("Grade: A");
} else if (score >= 75) {
  console.log("Grade: B");
} else {
  console.log("Grade: C");
}

4. switch Statement
The switch statement is an alternative to multiple if...else if statements, making the code more readable when dealing with many conditions.

Syntax:
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to execute if expression === value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to execute if expression === value2
    break;
  default:
    // code to execute if no case matches
}
Example:
let day = 3;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    console.log("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("Invalid day");
}

Loops
Loops allow you to repeat a block of code as long as a specific condition is true.

1. for Loop
The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you need to repeat a block of code.

Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // code to execute
}
Example:
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log("Iteration:", i);
}

2. while Loop
The while loop repeats a block of code as long as the condition is true.

Syntax:
while (condition) {
  // code to execute
}
Example:
let count = 1;

while (count <= 3) {
  console.log("Count:", count);
  count++;
}

3. do...while Loop
The do...while loop is similar to the while loop but ensures the code is executed at least once, regardless of the condition.

Syntax:
do {
  // code to execute
} while (condition);
Example:
let number = 1;

do {
  console.log("Number:", number);
  number++;
} while (number <= 3);

4. for...of Loop
The for...of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays.

Syntax:
for (variable of iterable) {
  // code to execute
}
Example:
let fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];

for (let fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit);
}

5. for...in Loop
The for...in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.

Syntax:
for (key in object) {
  // code to execute
}
Example:
let user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };

for (let key in user) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${user[key]}`);
}

Break and Continue
Break
Terminates the loop immediately.
Example:
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) break;
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 1, 2
Continue
Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
Example:
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  if (i === 3) continue;
  console.log(i);
}
// Output: 1, 2, 4, 5

Quick Practice
Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a loop.
Use an if...else statement to check if a number is even or odd.
Create a for loop that prints the multiplication table of 5.

Conclusion
Control flow structures are the backbone of programming logic. With if, else, and loops, you can create dynamic, interactive programs that respond to different conditions.

Tomorrow in Day 8, weâ€™ll explore JavaScript Arrays, one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures.

Stay tuned, and happy coding! ðŸš€
